# 🎓 ITI Online Examination System -  Database & Power BI Dashboards

This project is part of my ITI Graduation Project, where My Team and I designed and implemented a full **Examination System** covering all aspects of a complex educational institution. It includes a **relational SQL Server database** with 21 interconnected tables, alongside **20+ Power BI dashboards** for deep data analysis and decision-making insights.
